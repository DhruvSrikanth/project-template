A template for anyone interested in engaging in technical projects involving code.

Disclaimer: This has been built for `Python`-based projects. If you would like to adapt it toward another language, it is super easy to do! Just switch out the `Python`-specific files for the language of your choice. This means altering the following files:

- `requirements.txt` - this is the file that lists the dependencies for the project
- `.gitignore` - switch out the `Python`-specific files for the language of your choice

No matter what project you are engaged in, you will probably have to change the following (for obvious reasons lol):

- `src/__init__.py` - this is the entry point for the package
- `src/main.py` - this is the entry point for the project
