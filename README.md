A template for anyone interested in engaging in technical projects involving code.

This enables you to:
- **NOT** worry about Python version
- **NOT** worry about Python dependencies
- **NOT** worry creating or activating virtual environments

All you need are:
- [Python](https://www.python.org)
- [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
- [Direnv](https://direnv.net)

## Getting Started

Run the following:
```bash
bash setup.sh
```

Thats it! :)

After this, you can add whatever code you'd like inside the src folder! Never worry about reproducing code. When you enter your project folder, you are ready to start coding, as programming was meant to be!

> -  Disclaimer: Modify the README and LICENSE as you see fit!

## Non-Python Project

This has been built for `Python`-based projects. If you would like to adapt it toward another language, it is super easy to do! Just switch out the `Python`-specific files for the language of your choice. This means altering the following files:

- `requirements.txt` - this is the file that lists the dependencies for the project
- `.gitignore` - switch out the `Python`-specific files for the language of your choice
