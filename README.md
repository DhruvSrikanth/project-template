A template for anyone interested in engaging in technical projects involving code.


## Getting Started

Run the following:
```bash
bash setup.sh
```

Thats it! :)

After this, you can add whatever code you'd like inside the src folder!

## Non-Python Project

This has been built for `Python`-based projects. If you would like to adapt it toward another language, it is super easy to do! Just switch out the `Python`-specific files for the language of your choice. This means altering the following files:

- `requirements.txt` - this is the file that lists the dependencies for the project
- `.gitignore` - switch out the `Python`-specific files for the language of your choice
